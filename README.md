<a href="http://threatbutt.com/">ThreatButt</a> + <a href="http://logrhythm.com">SIEM</a> Integration = Defense in Derpth(TM)

Currently everyone is being attacked, all the time, by people from all over the world. But, how do we know who is actually attacking our networks? Thankfully the folks at ThreatButt have developed a groundbreaking threaty threat attribution feed. Using their patented Clown Strike technology we are able to harness the raw power of private, hybrid, public and cumulus cloudsystem to bring Viking grade threat intelligence to any enterprise.

With this technology we can know instantly who attacked us, from where, using what tech and most importantly, generate loud and progressively more annoying voice-alerts that provide the SOC with 100% accurate information about the attack throughout the day.

# [How To]

This script is super complicated and requires a Computer Science degree to operate:

	PS C:\> .\threatbutt.ps1

After you run this once... You can simply invoke the threatbutt to replay the script:

	PS C:\> butt

No need to provide real data, the ThreatButt knows who is attacking you and why...

![Script](/images/script.png)

Make sure you have your volume turned up!

Once the script executes, it creates log files. You can use these to find known malicious activity, just search for the EVID 1337!

If you're a ninja, integrate this with your SIEM so that you know when attacks happen and can announce it throughout the company.

# [Use Cases]

1) Configure as a LogRhythm SmartResponse(TM) to fire for alarms of your choosing!

2) Run this on infected systems to automatically know what APT resides there

3) Execute this remotely on unsuspecting user's systems... Better yet, create a scheduled task!

4) Just run it, yo!

# [DISCLAIMER]

1) This is an Obvious Parody...

2) LogRhythm does not actually endorse any of this in any way, shape, or form

3) All attribution data is randomly generated

4) We don't even send any real data to their API, for obvious reasons

5) How do you computer?
